# Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of interesting data structures and algorithms.

### Structure

- `Crypto` In this directory you will find a few toy implementaitons of cryptography related functions and systems. Most notably, here I have implemented a basic version of the  RSA public-key cryptosystem in Python and C++.

- `Data-Structures` Here I have implemented several common data structures in C and C++. These include a Red-Black Tree, AVL tree, Min-Heap, linear probing hash table.

- `Machine-Learning` In this directory I have implemented a few machine learning algorithms from first principles. These include a basic Q-Learning algorithm, written in C++, and a deep neural network class written in Python. The Neural Network class implements forward a backward propagation on top of Numpy in fully DNNs with arbitrary architecture. Specifically, the deep neural network may have any number of hidden layers with any number of neurons. It supports dropout regularization, ADAM optimization, different choices of activation functions, batch training, and L2 regularization.
