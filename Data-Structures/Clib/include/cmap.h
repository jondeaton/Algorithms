 * and the CMap will apply that function to a value that is being
 * removed/replaced/disposed. The cleanup function takes one void* pointer
 * that points to the value.
 *
 * The typedef allows the nickname "CleanupValueFn" to stand in for the
 * longer declaration. CleanupValueFn can be used as the declared type
 * for a variable, parameter, struct field, and so on.

 * ----------

 * (That struct is completed in the implementation code not visible to
 * clients). The incomplete type forces the client to respect the privacy
 * of the representation. Client declare variables only of type CMap *
 * (pointers only, never of the actual struct) and cannot dereference
 * a CMap * nor attempt to read/write its internal fields. A CMap
 * is manipulated solely through the functions listed in this interface
 * (this is analogous to how you use a FILE *).

/**
 * Function: cmap_create
 * Usage: CMap *m = cmap_create(sizeof(int), 10, NULL)
 * ---------------------------------------------------
 * Creates a new empty CMap and returns a pointer to it. The pointer
 * is to storage allocated in the heap. When done with the CMap, the
 * client must call cmap_dispose to dispose of it. If allocation fails, an
 * assert is raised.
 *
 * The valuesz parameter specifies the size, in bytes, of the type of
 * values that will be stored in the CMap. For example, to store values of
 * type double, the client passes sizeof(double) for the valuesz. All values
 * stored in a given CMap must be of the same type. An assert is raised
 * if valuesz is zero.
 *
 * The capacity_hint parameter is an estimate of the number of entries
 * that will be stored in this CMap. The internal storage will be
 * optimized for this size. The capacity_hint is not a binding limit. 
 * If the number of entries exceeds original hint, the map accepts 
 * additional entries but performance may suffer. If capacity_hint is 0, 
 * an internal default value is used. (As a special case, our sample 
 * CMap interprets 0 capacity hint as a request to enable flexible resizing
 * that adapts to load and maintains fast performance for any number of
 * entries. This behavior is not expected in your implementation.)
 * The CMap has its best performance when the given capacity_hint is close 
 * to the number of entries added. If configured for a much-too-small capacity,
 * the CMap operations will degrade from constant to linear time. If 
 * configured for a much-too-large capacity, the CMap will consume 
 * excessive amounts of memory.
 *
 * The fn is a client callback that will be called on a value being
 * removed/replaced (via cmap_remove/cmap_put, respectively) and on every value
 * in the CMap when it is destroyed (via cmap_dispose). The client can use this
 * function to do any deallocation/cleanup required for the value, such as
 * freeing memory to which the value points (if the value is or contains a
 * pointer). The client can pass NULL for fn if values don't require any
 * cleanup.
 *
 * Asserts: zero elemsz, allocation failure
 * Assumes: cleanup fn is valid

 * being overwritten, the client's cleanup function is called on the old value.
 * addr is expected to be a valid pointer to a value. For example, if this 
 * CMap has been created for int values, addr should be the memory location 
 * where the desired int value is stored. The value at that location is 
 * copied into internal CMap storage. CMap makes a copy of the key string
 * and stores the copy internally with the value. Note that keys are 
 * compared case-sensitively, e.g. "binky" is not the same key as "BinKy".

 * If key is not found, then NULL is returned as a sentinel. The function
 * returns a pointer to the value within the CMap's storage. This pointer

 * returned by cmap_get will become invalid during a call that removes this key.

 * previous call to cmap_first/cmap_next. The CMap supports
 * multiple simultaneous iterations without cross-interference. The client
 * must not add/remove/rearrange CMap entries in the midst of iterating.
